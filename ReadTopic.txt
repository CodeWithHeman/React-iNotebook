- What is a useEffect?
    useEffect(callback, dependencies) is the hook that manages the side-effects in functional components.
- Why is useEffect used?
    useEffect Hook is to eliminate the side-effects of using class-based components. For example, tasks like updating the DOM, fetching data from API end-points, setting up subscriptions or timers, etc can be lead to unwarranted side-effects.
- What is useState and useEffect in React?
    To put it simply, both useState and useEffect enhance functional components to make them do things that classes can but functional components (without hooks) cannot:

    useState allows functional components to have state, like this.state in class components.
    useEffect allows functional components to have lifecycle methods (such as componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate and componentWillUnmount) in one single API.
